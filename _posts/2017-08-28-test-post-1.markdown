Hello and welcome to my content.
This post serves as an example of what I can do using the post format provided by Jekyll. This text is quite simply entered, and images are easy to implement as well. Here's one:
![Example image]({{ site.url}}/assets/example.jpg)

Another great feature seems to be code snippets. Here's one:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
